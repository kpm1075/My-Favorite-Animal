<p>The canadian lynx is my favorite animal, primarily because it is one of the apex winter-hunting predators. It uses its fur coat as both a source of heat and as a camouflage tool to blend in with the winter woods. It has large fur-covered paws that act as snowshoes to move quickly and easily over the snow while hunting snowshoe hares. It also has an amazing sense sight, smell, and especially hearing, meaning that escaping its grasp in a hunt is nearly impossible for small prey.</p>
